# Omacalc

A dead-simple calculator built with Qt Quick and C++ that automatically follows the Omarchy theme and system dark/light mode.

## Install

Install via the Omarchy Package Repository via the `omacalc` package.

## Usage

The keypad covers the basics: the four arithmetic operators with the usual
precedence (`×` and `÷` before `+` and `−`), decimals, percent, sign toggle,
and backspace. The expression builds up above the display and stays visible
with the result after `=`, so `42 × 3 + 7` reads back exactly as it was entered.

Everything works from the keyboard too:

- `0-9`, `.`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` enter digits and operators.
- `Enter` or `=` calculates.
- `Backspace` deletes the last digit.
- `Escape` clears.
- `S` toggles the sign.
- `Ctrl+C` copies the result.
- `Ctrl+?` shows the keyboard shortcut reference.

Colors follow the current Omarchy theme (`~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml`)
and re-tint live when the theme changes. Text follows the desktop text size —
`omarchy display text size`, or GNOME's `text-scaling-factor`.

## Requirements

- Qt 6: `qt6-base`, `qt6-declarative`, `qt6-quickcontrols2`
- `xdg-desktop-portal` and a portal backend
